-- Optimizing queries, sorting and grouping data

-- Refining Your Query:

-- A. retrieve some data from the "film" table
SELECT * FROM film

-- B. retrieve data from “film_id” and “title” columns
SELECT film_id,
       title
FROM film
LIMIT 5


-- Ordering the Data:

-- Selecting every film from the "film" table, and 
-- the movies sorted by title from A to Z, then by 
-- most recent release year, and then by highest to lowest rental rate. 
SELECT film_id,
       title,
       release_year,
       rental_rate
FROM film
ORDER BY title ASC, 
         release_year DESC,
         rental_rate DESC


-- Grouping Data:

-- retrieve the average rental rate for each rating category
-- retrieve the minimum and maximum rental durations for each rating category
SELECT rating,
AVG(rental_rate) AS AVG_rental_rate,
MIN(rental_duration) AS MIN_rental_duration,
MAX(rental_duration) AS MAX_rental_duration
FROM film
ORDER BY rating
